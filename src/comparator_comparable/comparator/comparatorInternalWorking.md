The Comparator in Java is used to define a custom sorting logic for objects. Here’s what happens inside the Comparator:

How Comparator Works
1.	Two Objects Are Passed to compare:
•	When sorting a list, the compare method of the Comparator is called repeatedly with pairs of objects to determine their order.
•	The method compares the two objects and returns an integer value to indicate their relative order.
2.	Return Value of compare:
•	-1: The first object is less than the second (comes before).
•	0: Both objects are equal.
•	1: The first object is greater than the second (comes after).
3.	Iterative Pairwise Comparison:
•	Sorting algorithms (e.g., Timsort in Java) repeatedly call compare on pairs of elements to decide how to rearrange them.
•	Comparisons continue until the entire list is sorted according to the defined logic.

Example Walkthrough

For this list of employees:

List<Employee> employees = Arrays.asList(
new Employee("Alice", 1, 50000L),
new Employee("Bob", 2, 60000L),
new Employee("Charlie", 3, 50000L)
);

Using the Comparator:

Comparator<Employee> comparator = (i, j) -> {
int salaryComparison = j.salary.compareTo(i.salary); // Descending salary
if (salaryComparison == 0) {
return i.name.compareTo(j.name); // Ascending name
}
return salaryComparison;
};

Step-by-Step Process
1.	First Comparison:
•	Compare Bob (60000) with Alice (50000):
•	j.salary.compareTo(i.salary) → 60000.compareTo(50000) → 1.
•	Bob comes before Alice.
2.	Second Comparison:
•	Compare Charlie (50000) with Bob (60000):
•	j.salary.compareTo(i.salary) → 50000.compareTo(60000) → -1.
•	Charlie comes after Bob.
3.	Third Comparison:
•	Compare Charlie (50000) with Alice (50000):
•	j.salary.compareTo(i.salary) → 50000.compareTo(50000) → 0.
•	Tiebreaker: Compare names:
•	i.name.compareTo(j.name) → "Charlie".compareTo("Alice") → Positive value.
•	Alice comes before Charlie.

Behind the Scenes
•	Sorting Algorithms:
•	Java’s Collections.sort and List.sort use the Timsort algorithm, which is a hybrid of Merge Sort and Insertion Sort.
•	It minimizes comparisons and swaps by leveraging the compare method.
•	Comparator Usage:
•	Every time two elements need to be compared during sorting, the compare method is invoked.
•	The sorting algorithm uses the result to decide whether to swap the elements.

Visualization

Consider sorting {Bob, Alice, Charlie} by the above logic:
1.	Compare Bob and Alice → Bob wins (placed first).
2.	Compare Charlie and Bob → Bob wins (Charlie placed after Bob).
3.	Compare Charlie and Alice → Alice wins (Charlie placed after Alice).

Result: {Bob, Alice, Charlie}.

This process repeats until all elements are sorted according to the Comparator logic.
